# KolUmBot
This repo contains codes for the 2D animation of the AMR movement and sensor data for the KolUmBot Project at Technical University of Munich.

## Current Development
At the moment, the work is underway to visualize simulated point clouds generated by LiDARs mounted on multiple AMRs (each robot has two of them). These point clouds will be moving with the robots as they traverse the environment and color-coded to reflect the classes of objects they detect.
